# Intro to Queue Data Structures
#as we know stack follow LIFO last in first out
#but this Queue follows FIFO first in first out
#it had this 5 functionality
#1.Enqueue(i.e push in stack)
#2.Dequeue(i.e pop in stack)
#3.size()
#4.isEmpty()
#5.front()


#Queue has 2 parts i.e front(starting point(First element in Queue)) and rear(end point(last element in the Queue)) in a Queue


#Please look at notes as well
